Udacity VR Nanodegree Project 3 Maze
by Michael Strobl

In this project you can experience my third Unity application on your Android phone.
It's a maze where you have to find a key to unlock the exit (blocked by a big wood door). Additionally, you can find coins.

How long did I take?
It took me around 7 hours. 


What I liked?
- building the maze 


What was challenging?
- door script
